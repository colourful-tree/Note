    [
      sudo vim /usr/local/bin/tensorboard
      add
        from tensorflow.contrib import bayesflow
      before
        from tensorflow.tensorboard.tensorboard import main
      [I noticed if just import bayesflow and then import main, it is fine. But if changing the order, it will have error like you.]

update:
  pip install --upgrade tensorflow
