1.tensorflow 源码下载：
  nohup git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow &
2.bazel 安装
  见bazel
3.额外库
  基本已经安好，如果少的话，少什么安什么
4.编译
  (a)    nohup bazel build -c opt --local_resources 1024,.5,1.0 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package &
  其中--local_resources 1024,.5,1.0 小机器上内存控制
  (b)    bazel build --linkopt='-lrt' -c opt --copt=-mavx --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse3-k --local_resources 1024,.5,1.0 //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
  [dropping the --config=cuda (if CUDA support is not needed) and the -k (since no error occurred during the compilation) works as well]

5.创建你的pip并安装！
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
  pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-xxxxxxxx-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
  
 ps: all for:
  [W  The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE3 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
  [W  The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
  [W  The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.]
